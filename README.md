## Truck Game


<!-- ![.](C:/Users/tokel/OneDrive/Masaüstü/My_First_Game/truckGame.png) -->

I made my first game with Unity. While i was making this game, I learnt Unity's key features.

The purpose of this game is "driving the truck without hitting the boxes".

I used a prototype file which has prepared assets. I have added C# codes on Visual Studio and made little settings on Unity.
